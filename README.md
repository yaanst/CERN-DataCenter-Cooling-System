# CERN Data Center Cooling System

## Goal
This interdisciplinary project is for the Industrial Automation course from EPFL. The goal was to implement the cooling system for the Swiss and Hundarian data centers of the CERN.
The following points had to be done:
- Define the overall system architecture (including communication infrastructure, hardware, software and communication protocols)
- Create a P&ID for one of the two sites
- Develop device servers and HMIs simulating the supervision system using [Tango](http://www.tango-controls.org/)
- Perform a security analysis of the system
- Perform a cost estimation

See the *Project-2017-DataCenter-description.pdf* file for more detailed information.

## Depedencies
You need the [Tango virtual machine](http://www.tango-controls.org/downloads/virtual-machine/) to be able to run the project. See *Project/README.md* for more information.
